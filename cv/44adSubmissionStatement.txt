Dianne Murphy graduated in 1985 with a 2:1 in fine art from Duncan of Jordanstone college of art, Dundee. She has lectured in art colleges in Wales and has exhibited widely with pieces held in collections throughout the world. She has been involved in many social projects over the years and currently lives in the Welsh valleys with her family. Images of childhood are employed as the visual language and the topics discussed have grown and changed throughout the years but are always from the perspective of a woman and mother, often feminist inD nature. Currently the idea of recognising how difficult simply navigating a life path can be, drawing on Jung's writings and following this questioning thread back through time is being investigated. Steel plate, colour inked etchings are produced by applying all of the coloured inks in one go. This is a time consuming process which means bigger plates can take a whole day to produce just one print. Inks move and merge during the wiping down process which means no two prints are exactly the same, editions are limited and Fabriano paper is used.
