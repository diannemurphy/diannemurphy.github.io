'The Images of childhood form my visual language which I use to discuss perceived injustices along with a range of personal ideas.   Most of my work consists of Steel plate colour inked etchings: coloured inks are applied in one application and printed in one pull. This is a labour intensive process but, coupled with the ochre background, it produces a mellow and faded tone. Fabriano Rosaspina paper also helps impart the mood of something that is not new.  Each print is slightly different as during the wiping process colours merge and are altered'.
