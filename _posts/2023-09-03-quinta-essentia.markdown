In our power, we are the fifth element: alchemical symbolism depicts the inherent power of women. The image asks people to appreciate the value of a female role in child nurture and bonding and to realise its crucial place within society. The visual language of childhood imagery is employed to, hopefully, connect on a fundamental level and the colours used invoke the feeling of something old and worn.
