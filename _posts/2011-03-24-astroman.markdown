Toy robot with a sexual twist. Coloured inks applied in one application and printed in one pull; quite a labour intensive process but, coupled with the ochre background, this yields a mellow tone. Each print is slightly different as during the wiping process colours merge and are altered. Fabriano rosapino paper helps impart the mood of something remembered.
