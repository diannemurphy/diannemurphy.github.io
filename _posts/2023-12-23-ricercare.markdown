Alchemical symbolism spoke to a secretive and mainly male order and, throughout the ages, females have also operated within their own uniquely insightful and intuitive networks. Unnoticed and undervalued, even by their own gender base, women remained the fundamental nurturing power which allowed successive societies to function and grow.

The Empress holds the orb and sceptre as symbols of her natural earthly authority. Sure of her psychological understanding and influence, she asks us to truthfully search within ourselves and recognise the fundamental being within: her purpose is to lead by example so that we too may focus on a resolved inner peace and realise our raison dâ€™etre.
